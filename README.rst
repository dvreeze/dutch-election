Dutch-election-2021
===================

This Scala project converts Dutch 2021 "Tweede Kamer" election results in XML format to (CSV) spreadsheet format.

For the data sets, see `data.overheid.nl`_.

Do I believe the election results, despite the presence of official data sets? No, I don't. I do not believe them at all.
Even if the election fraud was more hidden than in the case of the 2020 US presidential election, some things just do not add up.
See for example `stemfraude`_ (in Dutch).

The winner behind the scenes was clearly Klaus Schwab of the WEF, who with his Cabal friends is in a hurry (remember the
"small window of opportunity") to use the engineered Covid crisis to establish their beloved New World Order (or whatever
name you want to use for that despicable world dictatorship), at the expense of the entire world population.

Still, some people may be interested in CSV files of the Dutch election results, so they can be found here (or in other
places I am not familiar with).
